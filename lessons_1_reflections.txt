How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced

    The diff was very useful and easy to use. Since it helped to compare the code line by line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

yes,that  would be a lot of help. If by chance we have made any mistake by editing and lost the continuity or if lost the link we can refer to the older version and see the diffrence and changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for

    to find the changes made after each editing
